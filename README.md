[Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/blockfolio-browser-extension/)

## Manual (Developer) Installation
Due to difference in WebExtensions API between Firefox and Chrome
we need to maintain two different manifest files
(__firefox.manifest.json__ and __chrome.manifest.json__).

To run the extension via developer tools just rename the file
for browser you use to __manifest.json__.
